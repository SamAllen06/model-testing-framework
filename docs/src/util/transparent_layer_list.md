# Transparent Layer List
APP/src/util/transparent_layer_list

## Purpose
Serves as a data structure optimized for storing multiple sequences (layers) of
the same data with little changes between each. Has the same interface as a two
dimensional [Sequence.](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Sequence)

## Functionality
Stores a base layer, which is a Sequence of data that is, ideally, shares the
greatest percentage of data with the other layers. (In [OutputFileReader,](../testing/output_file_reader.md)
the reference data is used as the base layer, since most output variables are
not affected by changes to individual inputs.)

On top of the base layer, each additional layer is represented by a dictionary
mapping indices of changed values to their respective values. These dictionaries are
wrapped using TransparentLayer, which is a [Sequence](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Sequence)
storing a reference to the base layer, as well as the dictionary itself.
The dictionary only stores differences from the base layer, and, as the name
would imply, is transparent for all values not overridden by the dictionary,
allowing the programmer to access data as if the full dataset was stored.

## Examples
```
>>> from util import TransparentLayer
>>> 
>>> base = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> layer = [1, 2, 4, 5, 5]
>>> 
>>> transparent_layer = TransparentLayer(base, layer)
>>> 
>>> [val for val in transparent_layer]
[1, 2, 4, 5, 5]
>>> transparent_layer.get_comparison_map()
{2: 4, 3: 5}
>>> # For understanding purposes
>>> transparent_layer._base_layer
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

```
>>> from util import TransparentLayerList
>>> 
>>> base = [1, 2, 3]
>>> layers = [[1, x, x % 3] for x in range(1, 7)]
>>> layers
[[1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 2], [1, 3, 0], [1, 4, 1], [1, 5, 2], [1, 6, 0]]
>>> 
>>> transparent_layer_list = TransparentLayerList()
>>> transparent_layer_list.append(base)
>>> for l in layers:
...     transparent_layer_list.append(l)
... 
>>> [list(l) for l in transparent_layer_list]
[[1, 2, 3], [1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 2], [1, 3, 0], [1, 4, 1], [1, 5, 2], [1, 6, 0]]
>>> # For understanding purposes
>>> [transparent_layer_list._base_layer] + [l.get_comparison_map for l in transparent_layer_list._layers]
[[1, 2, 3], {1: 1, 2: 1}, {2: 2}, {1: 3, 2: 0}, {1: 4, 2: 1}, {1: 5, 2: 2}, {1: 6, 2: 0}]
```
